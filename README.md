## Upgrading from the old version

Because of the rework, a lot has changed like variables and template names. That makes it difficult to just copy paste the new templates. So, to use the new version, you **need to remove the old templates** and change your dashboards.
You can just download the [latest release here](https://github.com/damianeickhoff/HaCasa/releases/latest) and go to the [documentation page](https://damianeickhoff.github.io/HaCasa/cards/hc_climate_card) for the card usages.

This will be a one time thing. Newer versions won't have this issue.

## What is HaCasa?

HaCasa is a modern yet simple dashboard design for HomeAssistant.
In a world where smart home setups are becoming increasingly complex, this theme brings clarity and elegance to your Home Assistant dashboard. 

Itâ€™s perfect for anyone who wants a modern, professional look that enhances their smart home experience without overwhelming the senses.

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned Home Assistant user or just getting started, this theme and card design will help you create a dashboard thatâ€™s both functional and visually stunning.
