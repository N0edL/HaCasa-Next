## What is HaCasa?
a refined fork of the original HaCasa project. Weâ€™ve squashed some bugs, cleaned up the visuals, and added new card designs to take your Home Assistant dashboard to the next level.

## Documentation
All the documentation about downloading, installing and configuring can be found on our official [documentation page](https://N0edL.github.io/HaCasa-Next/).

## Credits
- Designed by [N0edL](https://github.com/N0edL) & [Damian Eickhoff](https://github.com/damianeickhoff)
- Logo design by [Fredrik Persson](https://github.com/fredrikpersson92)
- All the cards are created with [Button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) from RomRaider
- And of course the community, who [contributed](https://github.com/damianeickhoff/HaCasa/graphs/contributors) in every way they can through Discord, the forums or Github.
