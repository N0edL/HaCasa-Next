# Development

HaCasa is designed with an open and flexible structure, enabling seamless adaptation and development to suit your needs.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

To get started, we have provided a few guidelines for you for [Theme](theme.md) and [Templates](template.md). Additionally, you can check out the template files on [Github](https://github.com/damianeickhoff/HaCasa/tree/main/dashboard/HaCasa/templates) we use to customize and build upon.

We understand that development can be a challenging process, but we deeply value every contribution to HaCasa. If youâ€™ve created something remarkable, consider sharing it with the community. We are always eager to assist and incorporate your contributions into the main repository.

We are currently working on a streamlined process that will allow you to submit a pull request (PR) to our GitHub repository and upload your custom card. Stay tuned for an announcement once this feature is ready.
