To get started, explore our custom-cards page to understand the internal system that HaCasa utilizes. Additionally, you can check out the template files we use to customize and build upon.
We understand that development can be a challenging process, but we deeply value every contribution to HaCasa. If youâ€™ve created something remarkable, consider sharing it with the community. We are always eager to assist and incorporate your contributions into the main repository.

We are currently working on a streamlined process that will allow you to submit a pull request (PR) to our GitHub repository and upload your custom card. Stay tuned for an announcement once this feature is ready.
