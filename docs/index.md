{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We will provide you with all the necessary information to get started, including installation instructions, configuration options, and tips for customizing your dashboard to suit your needs.

We will also provide you with examples of how to use the theme and card designs, as well as links to additional resources and support channels.

## What is HaCasa?

The sole purpose of HaCasa is to provide a modern, minimalistic dashboard for Home Assistant. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, while still providing a professional look and feel. The SOAP (significant other acceptance parameters) is a key aspect of the design, ensuring that the interface is not only functional and understandable but also visually appealing to everyone in your household.

## So, its just a theme?
Not even close! HaCasa is more than just a theme. It includes a complete set of card designs that are tailored to work seamlessly with the theme. Without the HaCasa cards the theme means nothing and without the theme the cards are just a collection of buttons.

## Where does it come from?
There are a lot of great themes and dashboards out there, but I was never really satisfied. Always wanted something different and easy to understand for my family. Thats why I deciced to create something of my own and thus HaCasa was born.
I can't say this team is based on a certain designer, I just took a lot of inspiration from the HomeAssistant community and every designer showcase page out there.
