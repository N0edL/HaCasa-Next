a refined fork of the original HaCasa project. We‚Äôve squashed some bugs, cleaned up the visuals, and added new card designs to take your Home Assistant dashboard to the next level.

This page will guide you through everything you need to get started. From installation to customization, you‚Äôll find tips, code snippets, and a clear overview of what's new.

## What's New in HaCasa Next?

* üîß Fixed minor bugs and major visual inconsistencies
* üí° Introduced new cards using the `hcn_` prefix
* üé® Improved styling for a sleeker, more cohesive look
* ‚öôÔ∏è Still fully compatible with the original `hc_` cards

## What is HaCasa?

Originally the sole purpose of HaCasa is to provide a modern, minimalistic dashboard for Home Assistant. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, while still providing a professional look and feel. The SOAP (significant other acceptance parameters) is a key aspect of the design, ensuring that the interface is not only functional and understandable but also visually appealing to everyone in your household.

## Theme + Cards = ‚ù§Ô∏è

The new `hcn_` cards are designed to blend in smoothly and look great right out of the box. It‚Äôs not just a fresh coat of paint ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete vibe.

## Why Fork It?

We loved the base, but wanted a little more ‚Äì fewer rough edges, more consistency, and some fresh ideas. That‚Äôs where **HaCasa Next** comes in. It‚Äôs built with love, care, and a few extra lines of CSS magic.
