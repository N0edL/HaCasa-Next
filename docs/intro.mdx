# HaCasa ðŸ’œ
:::important Looking for help!
I've been working on HaCasa for a while now and I'm excited about the potential it has to enhance the user experience. However, I know that great things are rarely built alone, and I'm looking for passionate individuals who'd like to collaborate on refining the design and making it even more user-friendly and implementable in Home Assistant.

Whether you're a designer, a developer, or just someone with a keen eye for detail, your input could make a huge difference. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9uMs9zCT7d) to discuss this further.
