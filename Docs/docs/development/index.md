# Development

You can contribute to HaCasa by helping and developing a card. But, before you can do that, its important to know what the base rules are.

## Theme

Consistency is key and thus is it important to make use of the same style as all the other cards. Same borders, colors, fonts and layout. You can always start with the `base` template and modify it to your needs. But, to make it easier, I've provided a bunch of font styling and colors to use and play with.

## Colors

| Color value    | Font color utility   | Background color utility |
